Problem Statement#
We are given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from the range 0 to n. Since the array has only n numbers out of the total n+1 numbers, find the missing number.

Example 1:
Input: [4, 0, 3, 1]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: [8, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 0, 1]
Output: 7

let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
	if (nums[i] !== 0) continue;
	result = i+1;
}

return result;
