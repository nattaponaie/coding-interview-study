Problem Statement#
In a non-empty array of integers, every number appears twice except for one, find that single number.

Example 1:

Input: 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: 7, 9, 7
Output: 9

function find_single_number(arr) {
	var x1= 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		x1 ^= arr[i];
    }
    return x1;
}

Time Complexity: Time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we iterate through all numbers of the input once.
Space Complexity: The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
